*Description*: Scripts to conduct a plant community classification and ordination for forested plots in Arctic and boreal Alaska.

## Getting Started

These instructions will enable you to run scripts to conduct plant community classifcation and ordination for forested plots in Arctic and boreal Alaska using data from the FIA Interior Alaska SQLite database and the AKVEG PostgreSQL database. The AKVEG PostgreSQL database is a public, open-source [vegetation plots database](https://github.com/accs-uaa/vegetation-plots-database).
